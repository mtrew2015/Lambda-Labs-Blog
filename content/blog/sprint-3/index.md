### Individual Accomplishments This Sprint
This sprint was definitely a sprint that had its challenges. Our goal was to get all the functionality into the application. I had spent the first part of the week finishing up the functionality with Firebase for authentication and authorization. Using React Context API I was able to build a system using higher order components that is quite intuitive. Learning Firebase and successfully implementing it was a great accomplishment.

### Detailed Analysis of Connecting Firebase to Prisma.
The second part of the sprint, I spent time connecting the authentication system to the Prisma back-end we are using for this project. This being my first exposure to Apollo Client mutations on the front end, I had to navigate my way through the documentations and the examples I could find in order to successfully implement these in our project. I was able to get all the third party logins and the native users created in the Prisma database.

One of the issues that we had to overcome was when we deployed the branch to Netlify, on their free tier they don't like when you use your own Firebase solution since they want to push their own product, so they disable pop-ups, and since its the free tier there isn't much support, however we were able to deploy with Firebase hosting with relative ease.

### Weekly Reflection 

It was definitely a very challenging week. One of the challenges we had was being down two team members who had to leave to the team for personal reasons. That left the work load of those team members and left us a little short handed. However, we were able to overcome a lot of obstacles, and we should be wrapping up MVP for this sprint on Monday or Tuesday and then we can really drill into testing and handling any bugs that we may find. However, I think we did a good job as a team to succeed despite adversity. I look forward to the next sprint.
